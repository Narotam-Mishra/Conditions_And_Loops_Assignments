Question1 - What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

# Ans - Conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. The most common types of conditional statements are if, else if, and else.

1). if statement :- The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.

# Syntax of if statement - 

if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}

2). if-else statement :- The if-else statement allows us to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

# Syntax of if-else statement -

if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}

3). if-else if-else statement :- We can use multiple else if statements to check for multiple conditions.

# Syntax of if-else if-else statement - 

if (condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
}

# These conditional statements allow us to make decisions in our code based on whether certain conditions are true or false. They are fundamental to controlling the flow of a program and making it more dynamic and responsive.
